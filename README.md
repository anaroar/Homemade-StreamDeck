# Homemade Stream-Deck
## Overview
This is a homemade Stream Deck that costs less than $50 to make. Using an external numeric keypad and some scripts, you can create your own macro keypad that can be used to automate a process or execute different commands on your computer. This one in particular is scripted to be able to do the following:
- Run OBS
- Change scenes in OBS (including muting/unmuting the mic as needed)
- Create/save a video clip of the last 15 seconds
- Open other programs
  - Discord
  - Steam
  - Spotify
- Open webpages
- Generate a random question-of-the-day
- Skip songs in the user's media player

## Software Needed
To define and assign your macros, you will need to install an automation scripting language called [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/).

You will also need to install [Lua Macros](http://www.hidmacros.eu/download.php) to be able to execute your AutoHotkey scripts from an external USB device. The Lua Macros page is also where you can download HID Macros, under the [HIDMacros Download archive](http://www.hidmacros.eu/download.php) section. You will need both, as HID Macros is used to identify the event id of your keypad buttons.  

(Optional) I recommend using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) to write/edit your AutoHotkey scripts, but any text editor should suffice.

## Hardware Needed
- An external numeric keypad, like this [Rottay USB Wired Number Pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FFLNF5C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

# Other Materials
- 1/2" square [colored labels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M9F8TSB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the keys
- (Optional) A [keycap puller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HPC88HM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and a couple packs of [keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FZGETVU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

You don't neceessarily need to pull the old keys out and put new ones in, but I thought that more transparent keys would look better with a backlit keypad.
